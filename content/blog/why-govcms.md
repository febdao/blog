title: Why should we use GovCMS theme?
description: Now, with model web design, a numbered list is not just a plain figure. It can be a different font, size, position, colour, background and whatever.

## Full Support GovCMS
`govcms_zen` is a theme which is made by the GovCMS team.  It provides all of the elements that are required by the GovCMS distribution. There is also detailed documentation on how can use each element.

## Responsive layouts

With government websites, mobile audiences are increasing and new devices are appearing all the time. govcms_zen uses zen grids system to provide a responsive and adaptive solution without any effort on your part. Your GovCMS website will work well on any device.

## Accessibility
![Web Accessibility](https://www.lilengine.co/sites/default/files/inline-images/606090-636509991059676901-16x9.jpg)
You need to make sure everyone who needs your website can use it. This includes people with disabilities, the elderly and people who can’t use, or struggle with, digital services. Your website must be accessible to users regardless of their digital confidence and access to a digital environment. This includes users in remote areas and user’s different devices.

govcms_zen provides a starting point and tools to create accessible websites. Out of the box, GovCMS core functions and features (the distribution) are WCAG AA compliant and follow best practice service design based on the [Digital Services Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/)

## Web browsers support
![Web browsers support](https://www.lilengine.co/sites/default/files/inline-images/browsericons-768x329.png)
Websites can be visited from a range of web browsers, and a range of versions within web browsers. Government websites are no exception to this, so you need to ensure that your website supports the widest range of web browsers and versions possible.

The GovCMS theme provides support for web browsers starting from IE6 up to the latest versions of each popular web browser.

## Website Maintenance

My last point, but possibly the most important for Front-end developers: If all websites, that are built using the GovCMS distribution, use the same theme govcms_zen, it will be easier than ever for developers to maintain, fix and update the theme of these websites.
